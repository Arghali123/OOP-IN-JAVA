# Introduction to Java[Unit-1]
Java is an object-oriented,cross platform,multi-purpose programming language produced by **Sun Microsystem**.It is a combination of features of C and C++ with some additional concepts.Most Java programs contains classes,which are used to define objects,and methods,which are assigened to individual classes.Java is also known for being stricter then C++,meaning variables and functions must be explicitly defined.This means Java source code may produce errors or "exceptions" more easily then any other language.

Oracle acquired Sun Microsystem in Jan 2010.Therefore,Java is maintained and distributed by Oracle.

## Features of Java
- Object-Oriented:
- Platform independent: Programs written in one operating system can be able to run in any Operating System
- Simple: Include's may features of C/C++,which make's it easy to understand.
- Secure: Java provides a wide range of protection from viruses and malicious programs.
- Portable: Running the same program with Java on different platforms is possible.
- Robust: During the devlopment of the program,it helps us to find possible mistake's as soon as possible.
- Multi-threaded:It allows to write a program that performs several different tasks simultaneously.
- Distributed: Java is designed for distributed internal enviroments as it manages the TCP/IP protocal.

## History of Java
- 1990 James Gosling(Devloper of Java).
- Platform independent language(OAK).
- 1995 consistency.
- Applets(it was used to create GUI applications,animation,play sounds).
- JavaFX and Swing (used to creating GUI applications).

## Java Virtual Machine(JVM)
- JVM as it's name suggest is "virtual" computer that resides in the "real" computer as a software process.
- JVM  give's java the flexibilty of platform indpendence.
- JVM reads "byte code",interpret it and execute the program.

> Note:Java is a Statically-Typed-Language which means every variable must have specific data types before use.Jun data type
declare gara xam tei type ko data rakhnu parxa.
Java is case sensitive

- **Datatypes**:The type of data that a variable can  hold.
- **Variables**:are container where we can store values.
